              Karlad Lake is perfect for adventurous activities. The DTPC offers a smorgasbord of adventure sports in this pretty place. It is the best place for those who love to do zip line crossing and kayaking. If kayaking is too strenuous for you, you can always settle for the smaller thrills like climbing on rock panel, paintball, archery, and land zorbing.
<br>
<br>
The major attraction of this place is the zip line that is set up on a 50-m tower. This is the longest zip line set up in the state.
<br>
<br>
Besides, the 250-m aerial rope slide across the lake offers a real challenge and makes for a wonderful experience. The place also provides pedal boat and rowboat services for tourists. Apart from this, a floating boat-landing station is also set up on the lake that is spread over 10.5 acres.

                Rediscovering the Dance of the Warriors…
                The folk, ritual and tribal art forms of Kerala are deep-rooted in the cultural philosophy of its rural life. An art form which is a unique blend of life and myths, Padayani provides a multifaceted view of the cultural richness and unity of the people. A call from the distant past to the present, Padayani is a proletarian ritual theatre art form with pre- Dravidian origins prevalent in the temples of Central Travancore regions of Kerala. As the night winds blow, a splash of feral colours and daunting masks that wiggle to mysterious rhythms create a blazing spectacle</p>

              Padayani is a ritual theatre art form related to the Goddess temples in the Central Travancore regions of Kerala. Performed at night in the temple premises, the rituals of Padayani are a symbolic act for pleasing the Goddess Bhadrakali whose fury remains unabated even after her victory over the mythical demon, Darikan. The duration of the festivals varies from seven to 28 days according to the number of villages participating and organising it.
              <br>
              <br>
              The word Padayani evolved from the combination of two Malayalam words Pada and ani, which means a group of soldiers and rows respectively. Padayani, which means 'row of warriors' is believed to have been performed by warriors trained in Kalaripayattu to display their strength and chivalry in order to frighten their enemies from the southern part of Travancore. Thus this art form traces back to the rich martial art tradition of Kalaripayattu.
